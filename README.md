Pagesjs
=======

A framework for keeping code organized and readable in a one-page app. Native JS, noQuery! It does, however, allow you to use whatever libraries you might like in your main.js file - I use jQuery in the examples. NOTE: Using jQuery-1.5 in the examples, which is quite behind the times. I'll consider upgrading soon.
